* eel-dashboard-template
Template for getting a GUI and Python backend via Eel quickly up-and-running.

I often need to quickly spin up small scripts or applications to share with others that require a basic GUI. This is a bare-bones template that can easily be adapted for such use-cases.

This template uses the [[https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel][Eel library]].
