* eel-io-template
Template for getting a GUI and Python backend via Eel quickly up-and-running.

I often need to quickly spin up small scripts or applications to share with others that require a basic GUI. This is a bare-bones template that can easily be adapted for such use-cases.

This template uses the [[https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel][Eel library]]. To quickly get started:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Set up virtual environment and install Eel
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install eel

# Run the template
python3 app.py
#+END_SRC

** Currently Built-In Methods
- To *send data from GUI (Javascript) and trigger a Python function*, use the ~send_data()~ function in ~script.js~.
- To *write to the onscreen log*:
  + ~log("Log text here")~ from Javascript
  + ~eel.log('Log text here')~ from Python
- To *request data from GUI (Python)*, use the ~get_inputs()~ function:
  + ~data = eel.get_inputs()~
